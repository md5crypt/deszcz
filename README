Hello there! You can read the story online here: https://rawgit.com/md5crypt/deszcz/master/www-reader/index.html
You can also get it in epub format here:
https://rawgit.com/md5crypt/deszcz/master/www-reader/epub.html
Or in a neat PDF version here:

- splitted story content into multiple files. LanguageTool got to laggy when rechecking many kilobytes of text
- new epub generator written in pure JS

new JS-heavy web reader
- it saves users preferences and current position
- it looks good on mobile devices
- content fetched directly from github
- uses Hyphenator JS lib to make text pretty
- also includes a JS Windows-1250 charpage to UTF-8 convertor

The story content is inside deszcz.html. It's a plain text file, named html to make rawgit happy, as txt files ale blacklisted for some reason. I used some minimal markup inside the text file:
- /^!chapter\s+(.+)$/ for marking chapters
- /!line/ for marking forced line breaks
- /$***^/ for marking paragraph endings
- /([^\s]+)\s*\[([^\]]+)\]/ for marking a footnote $2 for word $1 ( i.e. "word [footnote text]" )

also added latex output generator, but who would care for a latex template for polish-formatted novels... the output looks pretty much like the www-version, A5-booklet

added epub format generator!

if u somehow read it, remember to leave some feedback. Do it by reporting some issues, technically we can call them bugs in the linguistics.

and now something very important:
if u have any, ANY idea what can be inside the book from Freja's dreams, PLEASE email me (borsuczek(at)gmail(dot)com)! The plot can't continue without it.

...and I have no idea why I'm writing the readme in English
