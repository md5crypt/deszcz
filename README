new JS-heavy web reader: https://rawgit.com/md5crypt/deszcz/master/www-reader/index.html
- it saves users preferences and text position in cookies
- it looks good on mobile devices
it's content is fetched directly from github, so it's always up to date.

The story content is inside deszcz.html. It's a plain text file, named html to make rawgit happy, as txt files ale blacklisted for some reason.
I used some minimal markup inside the text file:
- /^!chapter\s+(.+)$/ for marking chapters
- /!line/ for marking forced line breaks
- /$***^/ for marking paragraph endings
- /([^\s]+)\s*\[([^\]]+)\]/ for marking a footnote $2 for word $1 ( i.e. "word [footnote text]" )

added epub format generator! http://io.badgerland.eu/epub/ *currently probably broken*

if u somehow read it, remember to leave some feedback. Do it by reporting some issues, technically we can call them bugs in the linguistics.

and now something very important:
if u have any, ANY idea what can be inside the book from Freja's dreams, PLEASE email me (borsuczek(at)gmail(dot)com)! The plot can't continue without it.

...and I have no idea why I'm writing the readme in English
